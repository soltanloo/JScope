# JScope – Javascript Async Coverage VScode Extension

## Getting Started

1. Install global dependencies. To use JScope, you need these installed on your machine:
    - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
    - [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/download)
    - [Nodeprof.js](https://github.com/Haiyang-Sun/nodeprof.js): Follow the repository's readme up to a point where you can succesfully run Nodeprof.js. See [instrumentation/README.md](instrumentation/README.md) for more details on how we use Nodeprof.js.

2. Configuration
    - Open [`src/jscope-config.json`](src/jscope-config.json) and set `nodeprof_path` to the directory of nodeprof you installed from step 1.
    - Open [`instrumentation/nodeprof.sh`](instrumentation/nodeprof.sh) and update `javaHome` variable to point to a GraalVM-compatible version. You either had it installed on your machine, or freshly installed another version, updated `javaHome` variable accordingly. You should also add path/to/mx directory to your path in the same file.
     
3. Compile. 
    - Run `npm run build` to install packages used in JScope, and compile the typescript project.

## Running JScope in debug mode

After building the project, you can run JSCope by clicking on the
"Run extension" button from the "Run and debug" panel in VSCode. (You can also use the F5 shortcut as well)

![Step2](./media/step2.png)

A new VSCode window will appears, which has JScope installed. 

To measure coverage for any repository, it should be added to the current VSCode workspace, right click on the side panel, click "Add Folder to Workspace" and add your desired node.js project.

Now select the P icon on the primary sidebar. It should open Jscope's menu.

![Step4](./media/step4.png)

Before running JScope on any project, create a `jscope.json` file in the top level directory of the repository.
Fill in the `jscope.json` using the sample provided in [src/jsope.json.sample](./src/jscope.json.sample).

If a `jscope.json` file does not exist, JScope will use the default configuration for a project as defined in [src/jscope-config.json](./src/jscope-config.json).
It may fail to work properly if the test framework or test regex are not correctly defined for the project under test.

Now you can select the "New Coverage" Button, and select a project from the drop-down menu that appears.
Wait until instrumentation and calculation of the coverage. You can also see the logs in the debug console.
